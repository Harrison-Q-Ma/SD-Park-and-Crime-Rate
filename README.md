# SD-Park-and-Crime-Rate

This project is originally my final project for the COGS 108 (Data Science in Practice) in the Fall Quarter of 2020. I have reorganized the repository to show as a sample for my work. 

In this project, I cleaned and performed analysis on a dataset of San Diego Police Department's police responses in the year of 2019 to find out whether there is a correlation between the location of the park and the crime rate in that area. A more detailed description of the project can be found in the .ipynb file.
